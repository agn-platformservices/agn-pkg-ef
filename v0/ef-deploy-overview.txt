EF Notes:
- CustomLabels can't be deployed individually - compare AGN.prod to AGN.beta and make sure on EF* labels have changed
- Static resource names need to be cleaned up
- Apex class "JSONObject" ?
- Page "ApprovalForm" ?
- grep -i fullname /Downloads/PigtoBetaMyAccess/ObjPkg/labels/*
  
EF Deployment Steps:
- Workflow - do rules and alerts need to be specified individually?
